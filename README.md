Hi, I'm [Oliva](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivia-bellis-06365572/)! I am still growing in my career as a software developer but you can follow my continuing journey and projects here.

My primary language experience is in JavaScript, and I have enough HTML and CSS to do solid front-end work. Most of my work is dealing with front-end interactive development based around web map packages such as [Mapbox-gl-js](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js) and [OpenLayers](https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers). But I have dabbled in a lot of middleware tech using AWS to help deliver content to the front-end portion. I also have skills in SQL and various database systems from Oracle to DynamoDB. I have written code in VB, ActionScript 3, Java, and bash as well.

I have a varied background in archaeology and geographic information systems (GIS). Software devopment spurred out of these two fields. Recently finished up my masters in archaeology at Lund University where I specialized in digital tools and technologies in the field (GIS, 3D Modeling, Photogrammetry, UAV/Drones, etc...). My thesis was an overview of the state of long-term preservation of 3D data in archaeology through implementation of reuse, visualization, and distribution of said data.
